üìä Credit Scoring Business Understanding
1. Basel II and the Need for Interpretability
The Basel II Accord emphasizes a risk-sensitive framework for banking regulation, requiring financial institutions to allocate capital based on the credit risk of their asset portfolios. This regulatory shift underscores the importance of transparency, explainability, and documentation in credit scoring models. Institutions must not only quantify risk accurately but also justify their risk assessments to internal stakeholders, auditors, and regulators. Therefore, interpretable models‚Äîthose that provide insight into the factors driving a credit decision‚Äîare crucial. A well-documented and interpretable model ensures compliance, enhances trust, and enables effective internal governance.

2. The Role and Risk of Proxy Variables
In the absence of a direct label for default (e.g., ‚ÄúDid the customer default? Yes/No‚Äù), we must construct a proxy variable that approximates this outcome‚Äîsuch as defining default as ‚Äú90+ days past due.‚Äù While necessary for supervised learning, relying on a proxy introduces modeling and business risks:

Label noise: Proxy variables may not perfectly capture the true event of interest, introducing inaccuracies in training data.

Bias propagation: If the proxy is influenced by historical business decisions (e.g., who was granted credit), the model may replicate or reinforce past biases.

Regulatory scrutiny: Regulators may question decisions based on surrogate outcomes, especially if customer treatment differs due to an imperfect proxy.

Thus, proxy creation must be methodologically sound, transparent, and accompanied by sensitivity analysis to ensure business reliability.

3. Trade-Offs: Interpretable vs. Complex Models
Choosing between a simple, interpretable model (e.g., Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence) and a complex, high-performance model (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines) involves key trade-offs:


| Criterion                 | Interpretable Models                                        | Complex Models                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Easier to explain and audit                                 | Difficult to justify without model explainability tools                 |
| **Performance**           | May underperform on non-linear relationships                | Typically higher predictive power                                       |
| **Deployment Speed**      | Faster implementation, especially in regulated environments | Requires additional checks, governance, and monitoring                  |
| **Bias Control**          | Easier to detect and control for biases                     | Risk of opaque decisions if not properly interpreted (e.g., SHAP, LIME) |
